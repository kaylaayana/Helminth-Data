This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
beefdata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaylaayana/Helminth-Data/refs/heads/main/beefcow_masterfile.csv", header = TRUE)
my_data <- data.frame(date_collected = c("2021-01-01", "2021-01-02"))
sorted_data <- data %>% arrange(date_column)
ggplot(sorted_data, aes(x = value_column)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color="black", fill="skyblue") + 
  labs(title="Histogram of Value by Sorted Date",
       x="Value",
       y="Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

I am trying to make a histrogram showing the epg results for each month. I got stuck at an error message at data %>% arrange(date_column).
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
