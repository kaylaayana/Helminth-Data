This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

datum=read.csv(file.choose())

datum$date_collected <- as.Date(datum$date_collected, , format = "%m/%d/%Y")

datum$YearMonth <- format(datum$date_collected, "%m-%y")

subset_datum <- datum %>% filter(date_collected >= as.Date("2024-05-01") & date_collected <= as.Date("2025-12-31"))

monthly_counts <- datum %>%
  group_by(YearMonth) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

kable(monthly_counts, caption = "Goat fecal samples per month", format = "markdown")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
