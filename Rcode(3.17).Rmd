This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)

data <- read.csv(file.choose())

data <- data %>%
  mutate(date_collected = as.Date(date_collected, format = "%m-%d-%Y"))
# Create the summary table
 
summary_table <- data %>%
mutate(month = month(date_collected,label=TRUE,abbr=FALSE)) %>% # Extract month
count(month, species) %>% # Count occurrences
pivot_wider(names_from = species, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) # Reshape

# summary_table <- data %>%
#   mutate(Month = format(date_collected, "%m-%Y")) %>%  # Extract year-month
#   group_by(Month, species) %>%  # Group by month and species
#   summarise(Total_Samples = sum(samples, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%  # Sum samples
#   pivot_wider(names_from = species, values_from = Total_Samples, values_fill = list(Total_Samples = 0))  # Reshape to wide format

print(summary_table)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
