This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

datum <- read_csv(file.choose())

datum <- datum %>%
  mutate(date_collected = as.Date(date_collected, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))

datum <- datum %>%
  mutate(species = as.character(species))

summary_table <- datum %>%
  mutate(Month = format(date_collected, "%m-%y")) %>%  # Extract year-month
  group_by(Month, species) %>%  # Group by species and month
  summarise(Total_Samples = sum(samples, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")  # Sum samples
  pivot_wider(names_from = species, values_from = Total_Samples, values_fill =list(Total_Samples = 0)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
